/**
 * CREATIONAL PATTERNS INTEGRATION GUIDE
 * ====================================
 * 
 * This guide explains how all 5 creational patterns work together
 * in our e-commerce platform "ShopCraft".
 * 
 * PATTERN OVERVIEW:
 * ================
 * 
 * 1. SINGLETON PATTERN
 *    - Purpose: Ensure single instance of critical resources
 *    - Used for: AppConfig, DatabaseConnectionManager
 *    - Why: Configuration and DB connections should be shared across the app
 *    - Example: DatabaseConnectionManager.getInstance() ensures only one DB connection pool
 * 
 * 2. FACTORY METHOD PATTERN
 *    - Purpose: Create objects without specifying exact classes
 *    - Used for: PaymentSuiteFactory.createFactory()
 *    - Why: Different payment methods need different processors
 *    - Example: PaymentSuiteFactory.createFactory("creditcard") vs "paypal"
 * 
 * 3. ABSTRACT FACTORY PATTERN
 *    - Purpose: Create families of related objects
 *    - Used for: CreditCardPaymentSuiteFactory, PaypalPaymentSuiteFactory
 *    - Why: Each payment method needs processor, receipt, and refund components
 *    - Example: CreditCard creates CreditCardProcessor, CreditCardReceipt, CreditCardRefund
 * 
 * 4. BUILDER PATTERN
 *    - Purpose: Construct complex objects step by step
 *    - Used for: OrderBuilder, ProductConfigurationBuilder
 *    - Why: Orders and products have many optional parameters
 *    - Example: OrderBuilder().customerId("123").addItem(item).shipping("express").build()
 * 
 * 5. PROTOTYPE PATTERN
 *    - Purpose: Create objects by cloning existing instances
 *    - Used for: ProductPrototype for product templates
 *    - Why: Products have similar base configurations with variations
 *    - Example: Clone laptop template to create MacBook Pro, Dell XPS, etc.
 * 
 * HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER:
 * ======================
 * 
 * 1. SINGLETON provides shared resources (config, DB)
 * 2. PROTOTYPE creates base product templates
 * 3. BUILDER customizes products from templates
 * 4. FACTORY creates appropriate payment processors
 * 5. BUILDER assembles everything into a complete order
 * 6. SINGLETON saves the order to database
 * 
 * REAL-WORLD BENEFITS:
 * ===================
 * 
 * ✅ Maintainable: Each pattern has a single responsibility
 * ✅ Testable: Easy to mock individual components
 * ✅ Extensible: Add new payment methods, product types easily
 * ✅ Reusable: Templates and builders can be reused
 * ✅ Consistent: Standardized way to create objects
 * 
 * COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
 * =========================
 * 
 * ❌ Over-engineering: Don't use patterns where simple constructors suffice
 * ❌ Singleton abuse: Don't make everything a singleton
 * ❌ Builder complexity: Don't create builders for simple objects
 * ❌ Factory explosion: Don't create factories for every class
 * ❌ Prototype misuse: Don't use prototype for unique objects
 * 
 * WHEN TO USE EACH PATTERN:
 * =========================
 * 
 * Use SINGLETON when:
 * - You need exactly one instance (config, logger, DB connection)
 * - Global access is required
 * - Resource management is critical
 * 
 * Use FACTORY METHOD when:
 * - You don't know exact class at compile time
 * - Object creation is complex
 * - You want to decouple creation from usage
 * 
 * Use ABSTRACT FACTORY when:
 * - You need families of related objects
 * - You want to ensure compatibility
 * - You need to switch between families
 * 
 * Use BUILDER when:
 * - Object has many optional parameters
 * - Construction process is complex
 * - You want immutable objects
 * 
 * Use PROTOTYPE when:
 * - Object creation is expensive
 * - You have similar objects with variations
 * - You want to avoid subclassing
